# diffusers-testing-assets
The assets used in [Mindone test cases](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/tree/master/tests) refer to the backup copies of the content originally pointed to by specific URLs. This is because the original URLs may be inaccessible due to various reasons, such as broken links, website updates, or access restrictions. By employing these backup assets, the testing process ensures continuity and reliability, safeguarding against the unavailability of the original resources. In essence, it's a contingency measure to maintain testing integrity even when the original resource is unavailable.
